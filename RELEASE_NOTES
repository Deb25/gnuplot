		   GNUPLOT VERSION 4.6.7
	    ===================================

This is an incremental update of gnuplot version 4.6 containing a handful of
bug fixes found since release of gnuplot 5.  

Version 4.6.7 is intended as a source-only release of interest only to those
who for whatever reason choose to continue using the 4.6 series rather than
moving to version 5.

Fixes since gnuplot version 4.6.6
=================================
* FIX apply numeric locale when reading ascii matrix data
* FIX handle log-scaled color axis in colorspec "lc palette cb"
* FIX incorrect colorbox axis labels in polar plots
* FIX off-by-one error in color of contours when hidden3d is active
* FIX stats code was confusing the x and y dimensions of matrix data


		 NOTES TO PACKAGERS AND TESTERS 
		===============================

Configuration options for interactive use
-----------------------------------------

The 4.6 source code supports three primary cross-platform output modes
in addition to several platform-specific modes.

1) Cairo/pango/wxWidgets
   These terminals were introduced in version 4.4 and are now the most
   stable and full-featured option.  This set of terminals includes
   - pngcairo, pdfcairo, epscairo, and cairolatex for output to a file
   - wxt for interactive display
   This is the default configuration, but requires prior installation of
   libcairo, libpango, libcairo, libwxgtk, and related support libraries
   The wxt terminal (but not the others) requires wxWidgets.  Note that
   wxWidgets 3.0 is not yet supported.

   To disable all of these terminals:
       ./configure --without-cairo --disable-wxt

   To disable only wxt:
       ./configure --with-cairo --disable-wxt

2) Qt
   The qt terminal supports interactive display with menu-driven
   output to png, svg or pdf.
   The gnuplot 4.6 autoconfigure and build system handles only Qt4.
       ./configure --enable-qt

3) X11 (the "classic" interactive interface)
   This used to be the preferred interactive interface, but the newer
   wxt and qt terminals offer nicer output and a wider range of features.


Options for output to files
---------------------------

Of course the terminals (output modes) present in previous gnuplot versions
are also still available. These include, among many more obscure options:
- png/jpeg/gif output via libgd
- PostScript
- Many flavors of TeX/LaTeX output, including TikZ and ConTeXt (new)
- Bitmapped output to support many older devices (e.g. HP deskjet, epson,
  seiko printers, pbm bitmapped graphics files) is available if needed
  but is no longer configured in by default.
      ./configure --with-bitmap-terminals

Options for generating interactive plots for web display
--------------------------------------------------------

- Mouseable output for display on the web can be created using either 
  the canvas terminal (HTML5 2D canvas element) or the svg terminal.
  Both allow zooming, toggling plot elements on/off, and user-scriptable
  hot keys.

		          OTHER NOTES
		===============================

Installation
------------

You can download a source tarball for gnuplot version 4.6.7 from the 
gnuplot development site on SourceForge.

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot

Installation instructions are available in the source itself; the short
version for linux/unix-like systems is to unpack the tarball and then
build it:
		cd gnuplot-4.6.7 ; ./configure ; make
test it:
		make check
install it:
		make install

Pay careful attention to the output of the ./configure script.
It may indicate that some output drivers have been omitted because the
necessary support libraries were not found.  In general you need to have
previously installed the "*-devel-*" versions of these libraries. 


Known issues
------------

- Mac OSX ships with a terminal input library that appears to be GNU
libreadline, but isn't really.  The program tries to cope with this, but
you may get better results by configuring gnuplot to use either its own
built-in readline routines or the real GNU libreadline.

- The gnuplot build system is not very good at figuring out where to find
or install LaTeX-related files.  This can affect use of the new lua/tikz
and ConTeXt terminals.

- You can configure support for both wxt and qt into the same gnuplot
executable, but only one of these two output modes can be used in any
given gnuplot session.


Support
-------
Please report all bugs and installation problems to the bug tracker
on SourceForge:

	http://sourceforge.net/p/gnuplot/bugs/

There is also an gnuplot discussion forum on usenet group

	comp.graphics.apps.gnuplot


Development
-----------
The development branch of gnuplot contains many new features.
The current development branch is labeled 5.1.
Feedback and contributions of code are very welcome, but please realize
that development is now based on version 5 rather than version 4.
